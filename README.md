# Solutions_ACCI_ICS201
All the solutions to the Albert Campbell Collegiate Institute's ICS201 2022-2023 curriculum.
I hope it helps you in your learning or sparks an interest in computer science.
Alternatively, I hope it helps you survive the course if you find out computer science isn't your thing :D

I provide 2 solutions to most projects. They are usually pretty similar, but I have labelled the more interesting ones as such. The interesting solutions lack proper commenting, and are a bit more complicated. These solutions are most likely unintended or inefficient.

If you are just copying my solutions or want to test them out, you will need to delete or rename the original "main" file on the programming environment (replit) and rename the uploaded file to "main"
